Dear Sara and Jenny Bon

This season Bill Bon has been selected to play for the Raptors. ROAR go Raptors!
                        
You may be wondering why you are not in the same team as last year.
Unfortunately we have decide that disbanding the previous teams and creating new more balanced teams
was in the best interests of the League. We understand that football is a competitive sport however,
in children's games fun and good sportsmanship should be the priority.
This also applies to parents! I feel I shouldn't have to say this but given
the incident last season with the grapes, wheel chair and unsolicited advice now all over facebook
I feel I must remind you such behaviour is unacceptable.
Your fist practice session is on March 18th @ 1pm at Saxton Field, field 2.

Kind Regards
Joshua Wilson
(Teams Coordinator)
