Dear Robin and Sarika Soto

This season Diego Soto has been selected to play for the Sharks. CHOMP go Sharks!
                        
You may be wondering why you are not in the same team as last year.
Unfortunately we have decide that disbanding the previous teams and creating new more balanced teams
was in the best interests of the League. We understand that football is a competitive sport however,
in children's games fun and good sportsmanship should be the priority.
This also applies to parents! I feel I shouldn't have to say this but given
the incident last season with the orange wedges, push scooter and doggy doo in the car park
I feel I must remind you such behaviour is unacceptable.
Your fist practice session is on March 17th @ 3pm at Saxton Field, field 2.

Kind Regards
Joshua Wilson
(Teams Coordinator)
